# principles

### Life Principles

- good is better than bad (why?)
- Time is limited
- what I want: stability for allowing errors
- buy time to do what I want
- allow to Change my mind (career, companions, ...)
- have influence in decisions (why?)
- immortality in a positive way: kids, book, influence others
- questioning
- Learn from others because it is an economy of time
- If you have something to say, say it earlier rather than later even if that's difficult (elaborate and give clear examples)
-  is egoism necessarily bad? What if it is below other, greater principles? For example, assuming that "the continuity of the species" is important and that excessive procreation is not good, we believe that people in the present are more improtant than people in the future (not yet born)  -- similar reasonings can lead to similar conclusions, e.g. contraception. Is this inherently bad? Develop.
- becoming dispensable
-  have "useful" habits and hobbies -- imagine yourself 5y from now - will this habit be beneficial if I have started it years ago?
-  Don't always think about things that "stand the test of time" bc of not apparent benefits -- eg learning chess is not useful bc you won't be great or AI can beat you, but what about benefits to the mind etc

### Work Principles
- when the benefits aren't evident: think again and again and again - you may find out that there are other alternatives that are better
- How do you deal with disagreements? Give an example
- it's ok to make mistakes and unacceptable not to learn from them. Ego barriers (people who doesn't make mistakes is bad, bc they don't learn)
- ask childish questions until you understand the real deal
- management is all about aligning what you want with what the other person want without breaking motivation (..)
- Entrepreneurship is a daily fight for eventual and uncertain rewards
- make decisions putting yourself in the other's shoes; be considerate whenever possible and make difficult decisions when impossible
- begging to hire someone is a bad sign: the person should be willing to be together, otherwise retention will not be sustainable
- consultative decisions: everyone has a say but I decide
- Encourage bad news, and allow open communication, otherwise people will abstain from talking
- practice influence without authority


### Gap Analysis Y+3 (?)

What to get better at

- vision: what we need to fix
- leadership: convincing others of vision
- problem-solving: how we'll fix that
- operations: doing day to day moves to get things done
- strategy: steps to achieve the vision
- selling: communicating how we're fixing the problem (internal & external)
- product: building something great to fix the problem
- profit: making sustainable revenue and growth (allows risk taking and choosing what you want to do)
- market: understanding to whom I want to sell

### TO DO

- [ ] study variables that influence behavior (see CBT):
  - phylogenetic
  - ontogenetic
  - cultural
- [ ] study diferen√ßa between principles and values
- [ ] ultimate tree of life principles: what descend from what
